Ingredients
1. Good exploration, function approximation, planning to revisit areas already explored
2. Reward function to incentivize/dis-incentivize behaviors

Differences between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning?
* Supervised learning: We assume the learner has access to labeled examples giving the correct answer.
* RL: The reward gives the agent some idea of how good or bad its recent actions were.
  *   You can think of supervised learning as requiring a teacher that helps you by telling you the correct answer.
  *   A reward on the other hand, is like having someone who can identify what good behavior looks like but can't tell you exactly how to do it.
* Unsupervised learning is about extracting underlying structure in data. It's about the data representation

Open question: How to make multi model RL systems ?
